## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

### Overview

- Lastic is a blockspace marketplace built on Polkadot.
- The core idea behind Lastic is to make Polkadot blockspace more accessible and cost-effective for its users. We aim to create a marketplace for buying and selling 'coretime,' which will in turn stabilize pricing for offer user-friendly payment models, and even introduce subscription or futures options for projects. Imagine a world where launching or extending a project on Polkadot is as simple as flipping a switch - that's what Lastic strives for.
- We believe the coretime model is positioning Polkadot as a leader of providing quality and modular blockspace, and in order to provide a blockspace marketplace for *any* application, Polkadot's technology is best equipped for this inevitable future. This is why we're choosing to build on Polkadot.

### Project Details

The complete vision of Lastic is a broad and intensive endeavor that involves building on technology that is not yet complete nor wholly available. Our experience in this ecosystem has shown that embarking on such a journey would likely involve costly investments of time and code in technologies are likely to change and make our code irrelevant for the future of coretime and Polkadot as a whole. **We believe, for the scope of this Web3 Foundation grant request, that "thinking with the end in mind" is a prudent guiding principle that also has pragmatic utility and therefore would be creating a UI for the system Coretime Parachain.**

We expect the teams to already have a solid idea about your project's expected final state. Therefore, we ask the teams to submit (where relevant):

- Mockups/designs of any UI components
- Data models / API specifications of the core functionality
- An overview of the technology stack to be used
- Documentation of core components, protocols, architecture, etc. to be deployed
- PoC/MVP: A website where users can view the current state of coretime on Polkadot
- What your project is _not_ or will _not_ provide or implement
  - The ability for Polkadot users to manipulate cores, for example, by slicing them up
  - The ability to buy or sell coretime on a secondary market like what Lastic intends to provide long-term


### Ecosystem Fit

- Lastic fits into the ecosystem by providing users of coretime with an interface to evaluate the current state of cores available, cores purchased/owned, coretime sales opportunities, task assignments, regions created, regions in the instantaneous coretime pool, purchases of instantaneous coretime.
- Target audience: parachain teams, dapp developers, collators and validators, coretime providers, polkadot analysts and analytics providers, mev actors, dot holders
- The Lastic UI will meet the needs of users who want a user-friendly interface for understanding the current state of coretime on Polkadot. Lastic as a whole aims to address the need for a secondary marketplace for blockspace on polkadot by allowing teams with the need for more blockspace to purchase it, as well as teams with a surplus of blockspace to sell it.
- Are there any other projects similar to yours in the Substrate / Polkadot / Kusama ecosystem?
  - No.

### Team's experience

**Phil Lucsok**: Phil began his career in web3 as a marketing and communications manager for a Bitcoin startup in Berlin in 2013 called [BitcoinsBerlin](https://web.archive.org/web/20220707055043/https://bitcoinsberlin.com/). There, he created marketing campaigns for multiple products including:
- [All4BTC](https://all4btc.com/) - a one-stop shop for purchasing anything on Amazon or eBay with bitcoin
- Bills4BTC (later [Bitwala](https://bitwala.com/), Nuri) - a SEPA-compliant payment method for holders of Bitcoin for regular payments
- e4BTC - an electronics shop supporting purchases in Bitcoin

After this, he worked for 3.5 years at [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/), a web2 social media platform for scientific researchers, where he learned skills in Product Management, Product Analytics, UX development and copywriting and design, and industry-standard growth practices.

In late 2017, Phil joined Parity Technologies to lead technical communications on Ethereum and Polkadot. There he worked closely with developers to create promotional content for open-source products including Parity Ethereum, Parity Signer, Polkadot.js. It was between 2018 and 2020 where he represented Parity in Ethereum governance to help recover the stuck funds from the November 2017 multisig hack. 

He led the communications team for the first two years, growing the team from 1 to 12, where they created and executed the launch strategies for Polkadot, Kusama and Substrate. After that he joined the Ecosystem Success team to work with parachain teams to improve their communications and act as a liason between Substrate Builders Program teams and Parity.

Phil currently works as a freelancer but is focused on leading [Missing Link](https://www.missing-link.io/)'s marketing, communications and governance strategies. He is also an active participant in Polkadot governance discussions on the Kusamarian and in ChaosDAO.

## Development Roadmap :nut_and_bolt:

This section should break the development roadmap down into milestones and deliverables. To assist you in defining it, we have created a document with examples for some grant categories [here](../docs/Support%20Docs/grant_guidelines_per_category.md). Since these will be part of the agreement, it helps to describe _the functionality we should expect in as much detail as possible_, plus how we can verify and test that functionality. Whenever milestones are delivered, we refer to this document to ensure that everything has been delivered as expected.

Below we provide an **example roadmap**. In the descriptions, it should be clear how your project is related to Substrate, Kusama or Polkadot. We _recommend_ that teams structure their roadmap as 1 milestone ≈ 1 month.

> :exclamation: If any of your deliverables is based on somebody else's work, make sure you work and publish _under the terms of the license_ of the respective project and that you **highlight this fact in your milestone documentation** and in the source code if applicable! **Projects that submit other people's work without proper attribution will be immediately terminated.**

### Overview

- **Total Estimated Duration:** Duration of the whole project (e.g. 2 months)
- **Full-Time Equivalent (FTE):**  Average number of full-time employees working on the project throughout its duration (see [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full-time_equivalent), e.g. 2 FTE)
- **Total Costs:** Requested amount in USD for the whole project (e.g. 12,000 USD). Note that the acceptance criteria and additional benefits vary depending on the [level](../README.md#level_slider-levels) of funding requested. This and the costs for each milestone need to be provided in USD; if the grant is paid out in Bitcoin, the amount will be calculated according to the exchange rate at the time of payment.

### expose events
needs research

### creating a nice user flow diagram UX
thinking about what functionality comes first user interaction diagram

show an early sketch/ how it looks

### connect with subsquid api
since coretime chain is not on test net this will be done locally

### testing
